# Why a non-profit?
There are several reasons why establishing a non-profit foundation, as opposed to a for-profit startup, is advantageous for our mission to harness artificial intelligence (AI) to improve educational outcomes and make a lasting positive impact on the world.

**Impact on Jobs and Education**

AI has the potential to disrupt traditional job markets and educational systems. By creating a non-profit foundation, we can focus on supporting people affected by these changes without being driven by profit motives. This allows us to prioritize the needs of those who might be left behind in the AI revolution, ensuring that our work benefits the widest possible audience.

**Lower Costs and Accessibility**

As a non-profit organization, we can access resources and funding at reduced or no cost. This enables us to offer our AI-powered Learning Management System (LMS) to users at a dramatically lower price, or even for free, making it more accessible to people from diverse backgrounds and socio-economic statuses.

**Openness and Collaboration**

A non-profit foundation can foster an open and collaborative environment, similar to how Wikipedia has democratized access to information. By operating as a non-profit, we can encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources, allowing our AI-powered LMS to grow and benefit from the collective intelligence of its user base.

**Corporate and Public Support**

Non-profit organizations often receive support from corporations and the public in the form of donations, grants, and other resources. This support can help us achieve our mission more effectively by providing the necessary funding and infrastructure to develop and scale our AI-powered LMS.

**Balancing Revenue Generation and Social Impact**

Although a non-profit organization cannot distribute profits to shareholders or owners, it can still generate revenue and pay competitive salaries to its employees. Non-profits can charge for their services, as long as the revenue generated is reinvested in the organization's mission. This balance enables us to focus on our social impact while maintaining financial sustainability.

In summary, a non-profit foundation is an ideal model for our AI-powered LMS because it allows us to focus on our mission to improve educational outcomes and adapt to the AI revolution while benefiting humanity at large. The non-profit structure fosters accessibility, openness, and collaboration, and is more likely to receive support from corporations, the public, and other stakeholders. By operating as a non-profit, we can prioritize social impact over profit, ensuring that our work reaches the widest possible audience and promotes equity and inclusivity in education.

## Introduction

Education is a fundamental pillar of modern society, yet traditional learning models and systems have not fully adapted to the rapid advancements in technology. The AI revolution has the potential to transform education by enhancing teaching methods, personalizing learning experiences, and making education more accessible and equitable. According to the World Bank, 53 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries face the risk of learning poverty, which is the inability to read and understand a simple text by age 10. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant learning loss and increased inequality in education, with the most vulnerable students being the hardest hit.

The need for AI-driven education is further emphasized by the changing job market. A report by McKinsey & Company predicts that by 2030, up to 800 million jobs globally could be lost due to automation. This shift necessitates the development of new skills that will be challenging for AI to replicate, such as collaboration, communication, and critical thinking.

Our non-profit foundation aims to harness the power of AI to revolutionize education by developing an AI-powered LMS that is adaptable, flexible, and scalable. This system will be designed for independent learners, teachers, and educational institutions, providing a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to support learning and teaching.

# ScrumBan Project Management Reference and Guide
For our non-profit foundation project, we have chosen the Scrumban methodology because it combines the best aspects of Scrum and Kanban, making it a perfect fit for the development of the AI-powered Learning Management System (LMS). The project requires both structure and flexibility, as we need to adapt to the rapidly evolving AI technologies and respond to the specific needs of the educational community.

The key principles of Scrumban that make it suitable for our project include:

1. **Continuous improvement**: As we work on developing the LMS, we will constantly iterate and refine the system based on user feedback and advancements in AI technology. This aligns with our mission to provide the best possible educational experience for students, teachers, and institutions.

2. **Flexibility**: Given the fast-paced nature of AI development and the diverse needs of our user base, we require a methodology that allows us to easily adapt and respond to change. Scrumban provides us with the flexibility to incorporate new features and improvements as they become relevant and necessary.

3. **Workflow visualization**: Scrumban allows us to create a visual representation of our workflow using a Kanban board. This helps us to track progress and identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the development process.

4. **Iterative and incremental development**: By breaking down our work into smaller, manageable chunks, we can deliver value to our users more quickly and make frequent adjustments based on their feedback and our own learnings.

The documents used in Scrumban will help us manage and organize our project effectively. For instance, the *Product Vision Statement* will define our overall goal and purpose, ensuring that the entire team is aligned and focused on the same objectives. The *Product Backlog* will prioritize the user stories and work items that we need to tackle, while the *Sprint Backlog* will outline the specific tasks and activities to be completed during each iteration.

Visual tools such as the *Kanban Board*, *Cumulative Flow Diagram*, and *Lead Time Chart* will help us monitor our progress and make data-driven decisions. These tools will enable us to identify bottlenecks, measure efficiency, and allocate resources effectively. Lastly, the *Retrospective Meeting Notes* will ensure that we continuously improve our process by reflecting on our successes and challenges.

By adopting Scrumban for the development of the AI-powered LMS, our non-profit foundation can deliver a high-quality, adaptable, and scalable system that will revolutionize education and benefit learners worldwide.
